Conclusion
AEMS can play an important role in communication across various industries in the public and private sectors. Consolidation of repository, communication and identity represents a pillar of the web-based human-centric Next Generation Internet [4].
Overall Summary
The new email technology in combination with the UMA framework creates a composite architecture that meets the needs of the modern communication tool. The proposed solution can be used as a content services platform to provide the e-records storage, exchange and retrieval system protected by the standardized authorization framework utilized by users through the email application.
A consolidated access control and a new data exchange mechanism leverages email security and enhances the mail system utilization. The question arises as to whether the standard implementation of UMA 2.0 will fit into the current mail system and how difficult it will be to build the UMA email extension.
Future Work
The UMA framework brings into the new email ecosystem a web-based data storage and exchange technology that predestine the proposed system to become more than a bare messaging tool.
The following are potential future R&D areas:
    • Consider a Consent mechanism extension design.
    • Explore linked content using a clickable hyperlinks – linking content across the business.
    • Design an extension for exchanging tagged messages and attachments – grouping content across the business.
    • Design an attachment versioning extension – managing the attachment content changes.
    • Explore health information exchange between healthcare professionals and inspect use of email communication between patients and healthcare professionals.
    • Employ regular email clients and applications using JMAP protocol to support a standardized email API.
    • Design and use a proprietary GraphQL API to replace the poorly adopted JMAP protocol.
    • Incorporate an electronic mailing/discussion list system into the proposed solution to extend the basic email functionality.
A prototype implementation of the proposed solution, working as a proof of concept, would be interesting to build.
